# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis-

# overview
â€¢	This project aims to uncover actionable insights from Financial Analytics data using python and its libraries. I dove deep into financial analytics, focusing on the market capitalization and quarterly sales of leading companies. By using data cleaning and preparation , Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), key metrics calculation(mean, median) and provide actionable insights based on data trends. 

# This project involved several critical steps:
1. ETL Process: Extracting, transforming, and loading data to ensure it was ready for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through various statistical measures and visualizations.
3. Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with new features to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: Developing and tuning machine learning models to predict heart disease.
6. Evaluation and Interpretation: Assessing the models and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.

# Key Learnings and Achievements:
1. Developed a robust ETL pipeline to handle real-world healthcare data.
2. Conducted in-depth EDA to identify key trends and correlations.
3. Created effective visualizations that helped in the interpretation of complex data.
4. Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
5. Gained practical insights into handling and analyzing healthcare data, which is crucial for real-world applications.

# Tools and technology:
 Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and more.
